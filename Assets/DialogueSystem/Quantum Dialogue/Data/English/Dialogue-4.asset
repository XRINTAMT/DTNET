    MessageText: "Yes, of course. Mr. Edwin, a calm environment reduces stimulation
      and release of stress-related catecholamines \u2013 hormones that can cause

    MessageText: Yes, I agree that stressful situations cannot be avoided, but they
      can be managed, e.g., through relaxation techniques, guided imagery, and slow/deep
      breathing. We will learn it together. Do you have any other questions, Mr.
      Edwin?
