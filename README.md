# DTNET
DTNET VR app branch.

## Git workflow

### Setup

Install git LFS (https://git-lfs.github.com/). IMPORTANT: Also do the first step of ”Getting Started” run the command ”git lfs install” after installation to make sure it’s activated.

## Rules

For a new task start a new feature branch named "feature-*feature_name*" forked from the *main* branch. If finishing the feature takes multiple days I recommend merging from the *main* branch into your feature branch each day to make the eventual merging into main simpler.

Once a feature is complete move task to the Review column om Monday.
